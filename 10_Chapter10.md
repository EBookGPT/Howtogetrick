# Chapter 10 - Avoiding Common Financial Traps

Welcome to Chapter 10 of "How to Get Rick"! In the previous chapter, we discussed how to build a strong credit score, which is essential for any successful and sustainable wealth-building plan. However, having a good credit score alone is not enough to ensure financial prosperity. In this chapter, we'll take a closer look at the common financial traps you should avoid in order to protect and grow your wealth.

We are privileged to have Suze Orman, a world-renowned financial expert, as our special guest for this chapter. Her insights and advice have influenced millions of people around the globe, and we're excited to share them with you. 

## Suze Orman on Common Financial Traps

According to Suze, one of the most significant financial traps people fall into is impulsive spending. She encourages everyone to take a pause and think before making any purchase. "Ask yourself, do I really need it, or do I just want it?" says Suze. "If it's just a want, then walk away. If it's a need, then figure out how to afford it without sacrificing your long-term financial goals."

Another trap people fall into is trying to keep up with others' lifestyles. Suze acknowledges that social media can be a significant factor for this, pushing people to want more things and experiences than they can afford. "Don't fall into the comparison trap," Suze advises. "Live within your means and focus on what makes you truly happy."

## How to Avoid Common Financial Traps Code

To help you avoid common financial traps, we've prepared a handy code snippet that you can use to assess your purchases' true value. This code will help you make more informed decisions about what you buy and why you buy it. With this code, you can avoid impulse purchases and stay on track with your wealth-building goals.

```
def assess_purchase_value(item_price, item_category, monthly_budget):
    value_score = 0
    
    if item_price > monthly_budget/2:
        value_score -= 2
    elif item_price > monthly_budget/5:
        value_score -= 1
    else:
        value_score += 1
        
    if item_category == "Essential":
        value_score += 2
    elif item_category == "Useful":
        value_score += 1
    else:
        value_score -= 1
    
    return value_score
```

The above code takes three parameters - the price of the item (item_price), the category of the item ("Essential", "Useful", or "Luxury"), and your monthly budget (monthly_budget). It returns a value score ranging from -2 to 2, with higher scores indicating better value for money. 

Use this code the next time you're in a store or browsing online, and think carefully before making your purchase. Remember Suze's advice to ask yourself whether you really need it and focus on what makes you truly happy.

## The Story of Robin Hood and the Impulsive Shopper

Robin Hood, the notorious outlaw, had just finished a successful heist against the oppressive rich. As he and his band of merry men rode through the forest, they heard the cries of a man in distress. They followed the noise and found a man surrounded by shopping bags, clearly distraught and in need of help.

The man, named John, had always been an impulsive shopper. He loved the thrill of buying new things, no matter the cost. But this time, he had gone overboard, spending his entire monthly budget on unnecessary items. He now realized the gravity of the situation and didn't know how he would pay his rent next month.

Robin Hood, being a man of the people, took pity on John and decided to help him out of his predicament. He called upon his special guest Suze Orman, the renowned financial advisor, to assess John's situation and offer some guidance.

Suze took one look at John's shopping bags and knew what had happened. She saw that John had fallen into the trap of impulsive spending, which had left him with no money to pay his essential bills. She advised John to take a break before making any more purchases and to follow her three rules for financial security.

## Suze Orman's Three Rules for Financial Security

"Rule number one," Suze said, "is to live below your means." She explained that this means spending less than what you earn and saving the rest for the future. Suze recommended that John should set up a budget to make sure he was putting away some of his income into savings, even if it was a small amount.

"Rule number two," Suze continued, "is to invest in yourself." Suze recommended that John should take some courses or classes to help him grow his skills and earn more money in the long run. This would help John increase his income and have more financial security.

"And finally, rule number three," Suze finished, "is to learn to say no to things that aren't serving you." Suze advised John to resist the urge to keep up with the Joneses and instead focus on his own financial goals. "If your friends are living lavish lifestyles that they can't afford, that's not your burden to bear," Suze added.

## A Code for Spending Assessment

To help John avoid the trap of impulsive spending, Robin Hood's merry men devised a code to help John assess the true value of his purchases. The code would rate each purchase on its practicality and its ability to contribute to John's long-term financial goals.

```
def assess_purchase_value(item_price, item_category, monthly_budget):
    value_score = 0
    
    if item_price > monthly_budget/2:
        value_score -= 2
    elif item_price > monthly_budget/5:
        value_score -= 1
    else:
        value_score += 1
        
    if item_category == "Essential":
        value_score += 2
    elif item_category == "Useful":
        value_score += 1
    else:
        value_score -= 1
    
    return value_score
```

John used the code to help him evaluate his recent purchases and realized that he had spent a significant portion of his budget on things that didn't really serve a purpose. From now on, he resolved to use the code whenever he was tempted to buy something unnecessarily.

## Conclusion

Thanks to Robin Hood and Suze Orman, John was able to avoid the trap of impulsive spending and set himself on a path to financial security. By following Suze's three rules for financial security and using the code to assess his purchases, John was able to avoid common financial traps and focus on his long-term financial goals.

Remember, if you ever find yourself in John's position, think before you spend, and consult a financial expert like Suze Orman. Keep the three rules in mind, and use the code to help you avoid impulsive purchases. That way, you can live a financially secure life and achieve all your goals.

## The Code: How to Assess the True Value of a Purchase

In the story of Robin Hood and the Impulsive Shopper, Robin Hood's band of merry men devised a code to help John assess the true value of his purchases. The code is a simple Python function that assigns a value score to a purchase based on its price and category. The code is as follows.

```
def assess_purchase_value(item_price, item_category, monthly_budget):
    value_score = 0
    
    if item_price > monthly_budget/2:
        value_score -= 2
    elif item_price > monthly_budget/5:
        value_score -= 1
    else:
        value_score += 1
        
    if item_category == "Essential":
        value_score += 2
    elif item_category == "Useful":
        value_score += 1
    else:
        value_score -= 1
    
    return value_score
```

The function takes three parameters. The first parameter, item_price, is the price of the item being evaluated. The second parameter, item_category, is the category of the item and is one of three values: "Essential", "Useful", or "Luxury". The third parameter, monthly_budget, is the total amount of money John has to spend in a given month.

The function returns a value score, which ranges from -2 to 2. A higher score indicates better value for money. The score is calculated as follows.

- If the item price is greater than half of John's monthly budget, the score is decreased by 2.
- If the item price is greater than a fifth of John's monthly budget, the score is decreased by 1.
- Otherwise, the score is increased by 1.

Based on the category of the item, the score is then increased or decreased as follows.

- If the item is "Essential", the score is increased by 2.
- If the item is "Useful", the score is increased by 1.
- If the item is "Luxury", the score is decreased by 1.

Once John has run the purchase through this function, he can assess its true value and make a more informed decision about whether or not to buy it. This helps him to avoid impulsive purchases and stay on track with his long-term financial goals.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we've introduced a Python function that can help you assess the true value of a purchase. By using this function to evaluate your spending, you can avoid impulsive purchases and stay on track with your long-term financial goals. Remember to live below your means, invest in yourself, and learn to say no to things that aren't serving you. That way, you can achieve financial security and build true wealth.
