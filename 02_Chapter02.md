# Chapter 2: Setting Financial Goals

Welcome back to our journey to wealth creation! In the previous chapter, we learned about the importance of having the right mindset and attitude towards money. We discussed how to think like a millionaire and how to cultivate habits that pave the way for financial success.

Now, it is time to move on to the next crucial step in our journey - setting financial goals. Without clear, well-defined goals, it is difficult to make progress towards financial independence. 

To help us understand the importance of setting goals, we've invited special guest, Tony Robbins, to share his insights on the subject. Tony Robbins is an entrepreneur, bestselling author, and one of the world's top life coaches. He has helped millions of people achieve their goals and create the life they desire.

In his book, "Money: Master the Game," Tony Robbins stresses the importance of having clear financial goals. He writes, "goals form the roadmap of your life. They provide you with direction and purpose."

Without goals, it's hard to know what you're working towards, and it's easy to get off track. When it comes to financial goals, Tony recommends starting with the end in mind. What do you want your financial situation to look like five years from now? Ten years from now? Visualize your ideal financial situation, and then work backward to figure out what steps you need to take to get there.

Tony Robbins also emphasizes the need to make goals specific and measurable. Instead of setting a broad goal like "save more money," set a specific target, such as "save $10,000 in an emergency fund by December 31st, 2022."

Now that we've heard from Tony Robbins on the importance of setting financial goals, let's dive into the topic further. In the next section, we'll discuss how to set SMART financial goals and provide examples of goals you can set for your financial journey.

## How to Set SMART Financial Goals

When it comes to setting financial goals, the best approach is to use the SMART framework. SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Let's break down each element of the SMART framework and see how it applies to setting financial goals.

### Specific

Your financial goals should be specific and well-defined. Instead of saying you want to "save more money," set a specific target, such as "save $500 per month towards retirement." This helps give you a clear direction and has a higher chance of being achieved than a vague goal.

### Measurable

Your financial goals should be measurable so you can track your progress. This helps ensure you stay on track and provides motivation when you see progress towards your goal. For example, instead of saying you want to "pay off debt," set a specific target, such as "pay off $10,000 in credit card debt in one year."

### Achievable

Your financial goals should be challenging but achievable. You want to stretch yourself, but setting unrealistic goals can lead to frustration and disappointment. For example, it's not realistic to set a goal of saving $50,000 in one year if you only make $40,000 per year. Instead, make a goal that fits within your budget and lifestyle.

### Relevant

Your financial goals should be relevant to your overall financial plan. Consider your long-term financial goals and how each goal fits into the big picture. For example, if your long-term goal is to buy a house, then your short-term financial goals should be focused on saving for a down payment.

### Time-bound

Your financial goals should have a deadline. This gives you a sense of urgency and ensures you stay on track. Instead of saying you want to "save for retirement," set a specific deadline, such as "save $500,000 for retirement by age 60." 

## Examples of Financial Goals

Now that we've covered the SMART framework, let's take a look at some examples of financial goals you can set for yourself:

- Pay off $10,000 in credit card debt in one year
- Save $15,000 for a down payment on a house in two years
- Increase your emergency fund to $10,000 in one year
- Save $5,000 for a family vacation in one year
- Max out your 401(k) contributions for the year
- Increase your net worth by 10% in one year

Remember, the key is to set specific, measurable goals that are challenging but achievable. With a clear roadmap, you can make significant progress towards financial independence.

In the next section, we'll introduce you to tools and techniques that can help you stay on track and achieve your financial goals. 

Stay tuned!

## The Robin Hood Story: Setting Goals for Wealth Redistribution

Robin Hood was a hero of the people, known for his character and dedication to fighting unjust rulers. His exploits were legendary, and he had a reputation for fiercely guarding the wealth of the people of Nottinghamshire from greedy lords and corrupt tax collectors.

One day, Robin Hood was holding a meeting with his band of Merry Men to discuss their next course of action. Their group had amassed a considerable amount of wealth, but they knew that they could do more to help the people of the town they protected.

"Our cause is just," said Robin Hood, addressing his fellow Merry Men. "But we must set our sights on a larger goal. We must create a plan and set financial goals to more effectively help the people."

The merry men listened to Robin Hood's words, nodding in agreement. But some of them were skeptical about how financial planning could help them in their quest to redistribute wealth.

Then, Tony Robbins, the world's most famous life coach and financial advisor, appeared out of nowhere.

"Robin Hood, Merry Men, you're doing great work, but setting financial goals is a significant part of building long-term wealth and achieving your objectives."

Robin Hood and his Merry Men were surprised and intrigued by Tony Robbins' appearance. He went on to explain the importance of having long-term financial goals and how it could be used to redistribute wealth effectively.

"When setting financial goals, itâ€™s essential to make them specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. The SMART framework helps you create actionable plans that can be tracked and re-evaluated over time," Tony Robbins explained.

Robin Hood and his men listened intently to Tony Robbins' words, eager to learn more. They decided to take Tony's advice to heart and commit to creating SMART financial goals.

They set a goal to increase their savings by 10% over the next six months, using the extra funds to help the poor in their region. They also set a goal to target wealthy tax collectors that stole from the poor and donate the confiscated money to those in need.

With their new focus on setting financial goals and the guidance of Tony Robbins, Robin Hood and his Merry Men were able to increase their wealth and help the poorest in their community. They continued to set bigger and bolder goals, pushing themselves to work harder and achieve more.

In the end, Robin Hood and his Merry Men proved that setting financial goals could be instrumental in promoting social justice and equity. They not only changed their lives but the lives of the people around them by believing in themselves, planning, and working hard to achieve their goals.

## Conclusion

Robin Hood and his Merry Men learned a valuable lesson about the importance of setting financial goals to achieve a larger end. From Tony Robbins, they learned about the SMART framework and how it leads to the creation of actionable plans. With the help of financial goal setting, they were able to redistribute wealth effectively and make a meaningful impact on their community. 

Take a leaf out of Robin Hood and Tony's book and set SMART financial goals to achieve your financial objectives. It's a proven plan to help anyone to achieve their desires, and who knows, maybe you, too, could become a hero just like Robin Hood!

## The Code: Using Smart Goal Setting to Achieve Financial Independence

In the Robin Hood story, we saw the importance of setting financial goals as a crucial step towards wealth redistribution. In this section, we'll take a look at how to use code to set SMART financial goals and achieve financial independence.

As we discussed earlier, SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Let's see how we can use code to set SMART goals:

```
Specific:
```
```
I want to save $10,000 towards a down payment on a house.
```

```
Measurable:
```
```
I will save $500 per month toward a down payment on a house.
```

```
Achievable:
```
```
I will cut back on discretionary spending to save $500 per month.
```

```
Relevant:
```
```
Saving for a down payment on a house is relevant to my long-term financial goal of homeownership.
```

```
Time-bound:
```
```
I will save $10,000 for a down payment on a house in 20 months.
```

With these elements in mind, we can write a code block that sets a SMART financial goal:

```
# Set SMART financial goal
down_payment_goal = 10000
monthly_savings = 500
months_to_achieve_goal = down_payment_goal / monthly_savings

print("My goal is to save $10,000 for a down payment on a house in", int(months_to_achieve_goal), "months by saving $500 per month.")
```

Output:
```
My goal is to save $10,000 for a down payment on a house in 20 months by saving $500 per month.
```

This code block sets a specific financial goal - saving $10,000 for a down payment on a house, a measurable goal - saving $500 per month. It's achievable because the individual can cut back on discretionary spending to save $500 per month without sacrificing essential expenses. The goal is relevant because it aligns with their long-term goal of homeownership. Lastly, the goal is time-bound because the individual has set a deadline of 20 months.

This is just one example of how coding can help set SMART financial goals. By using code, individuals can track their progress and adjust their plan as needed. It's an effective way to ensure financial success and achieve financial independence.

## Conclusion

In this section, we learned how to use code to set SMART financial goals. By following the SMART framework, we can create a roadmap that leads to financial independence. Code helps us track our progress, adjust our plan if needed, and achieve our financial goals.

In the next section, we'll discuss how to stay motivated when working towards our financial goals.
