# Chapter 8: Creating Passive Income Streams

Welcome back to our book on How to get rick! In our previous chapter, we discussed the ins and outs of starting and running a business. Now, we will focus on creating passive income streams – a way to make money without actively working for it.

To guide us on this journey, we have invited a special guest – Robert Kiyosaki. Robert is a renowned author, businessman and investor. He is best known for his book, "Rich Dad Poor Dad," which emphasizes the importance of financial education and creating passive income streams.

Passive income streams can come from various sources such as rental income, dividends, interest, royalties, and profits from investments. The key is to invest in assets that generate money without requiring your constant attention.

One effective way to create a passive income stream is through real estate investing. Robert Kiyosaki is a big proponent of this strategy. In fact, he emphasizes the importance of investing in cash-flowing properties that will generate income for you even after all expenses and mortgage payments have been paid.

Another way to create a passive income stream is through dividends from stock investments. When you invest in stocks, you become a shareholder in the company, and you receive a portion of the profits in the form of dividends.

Finally, you can create a passive income stream through digital products. These include eBooks, online courses and webinars, and software applications. Once you create and market these products, they can continue to generate income for you without requiring ongoing work.

Now that you understand the importance of having passive income streams, let's dive into the How to get rick code to help you create them.

Before investing in anything, it is essential to do your research and select a passive income stream that aligns with your interests and goals.

However, if you're interested in real estate and enjoy learning about the housing market, then real estate investing may be a better fit.

Once you've identified your preferred passive income stream, it is crucial to invest in the right assets. For example, if you decide to invest in real estate, make sure you invest in cash-flowing properties that will generate income.

### 3. Monitor your investments.

While passive income streams may require less ongoing work than active income streams, it is still important to monitor your investments. Keep track of your cash flows, expenses and any changes in the market that may impact your assets' performance.

As Robert Kiyosaki has emphasized in his book, "Rich Dad Poor Dad," financial education is critical to creating passive income streams. Continuously educate yourself on the market, your assets and new opportunities that can help you grow your passive income streams.
